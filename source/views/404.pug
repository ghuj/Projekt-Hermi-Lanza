                    span :(
                p Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist.
                p It looks like this was the result of either:
                ul
                    li a mistyped address
                    li an out-of-date link
                .button-container
                    button.favorite.styled(type='button' onclick="window.location.href='index.html'")
                        span Back to Home
